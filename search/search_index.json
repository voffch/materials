Although there's much to be said on this particular topic, in most real-life situations one encounters the following scenario:</p> <ul> <li>You don't freely choose the synthesis method. Instead, you choose something that's available in your lab or in your collaborators' labs.</li> <li>You don't always optimize the synthesis parameters. Most of the time, you just tweak things a little 'till you find something that works for you.</li> <li>You can't calculate and predict everything. There's no software that feeds on the data such as \"oh, I want to obtain this and that phase with this here particle size distribution\" and yields an optimal method with an accurate set of parameters and instructions to follow so as to achieve the desired results. As a consequence, there's plenty of the good old trial and error in the synthesis of materials, and even those process parameters that can, to some extent, be predicted are often adjusted empirically. Somehow, synthesizing resembles cooking: you find some working recipe, change it to suit your needs, i.e., the ingredients and the kitchen appliances that you have, cook something, taste it, and repeat if necessary.</li> <li>And last, but not least: it is not enough to just synthesize something; you have to analyze the products in order to find out exactly what you've made.</li> </ul> <p>Thus, only a part of this course is actually about the synthesis methods and the sample preparation for subsequent analysis. The rest is devoted to various analytical techniques: powder X-ray diffraction and phase analysis, particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy, and thermoanalytical methods (thermogravimetry and thermodilatometry).</p>"},{"location":"#warning","title":"Warning","text":"<p>This website is under construction.

As chemists, when it comes to the definitions, we have IUPAC to consult with. This organization, among other things, provides us with the dictionaries of chemical and related terms, such as the goldbook.<sup>1</sup> Well, in this case, the goldbook defines only the nano prefix and what a nanocomposite is.</p> <p>nano: SI prefix for \\(10^{\u22129}\\) (symbol: n)</p> <p>nanocomposite: composite in which at least one of the phase domains has at least one dimension of the order of nanometers</p> <p>ISO, in turn, in its \"explanation of selected terms from the nanotechnologies\" note<sup>2</sup> gives the definitions of nanoscale and nanomaterial.</p> <p>nanoscale: length range approximately from 1 nm to 100 nm</p> <p>nanomaterial: material with any external dimension in the nanoscale (nano-object, e.g. nanoparticle, nanofibre, nanoplate, nanofilm, nanolayer) or having an internal structure or surface structure in the nanoscale (nanostructured material, or NsM)</p> <p>We see that to classify a material as a nanomaterial, at least something in it, along some dimension, should be nanoscale, i.e., from 1 to 100 nm. Pay attention to the word \"dimension\" here, because we'll return to it later.</p> <p>Another important point regarding the nanomaterials is aptly illustrated in the following quote, ascribed to Koelling from Argonne National Laboratory (USA):</p> <p>The nanoscale is not just another step towards miniaturization. It is a qualitatively new scale where materials properties differ significantly from the same properties in the bulk.</p> <p>This quote answers the question of why people are so obsessed with everything \"nano\". Thus, the main goal of preparing something in the nanostate should consist in obtaining the properties that are distinctly different from those of the bulk material of the same composition.</p> <p> </p> <p>The Scale of Things. Source - U.S. Department of Energy.</p> <p>But how small is 10 to the -9 meters? Please look at the scale of things above. We see that even the red blood cells are not truly nanoscale, as well as almost all bacteria and appropriately named microbes, which are at least several micrometers \"tall\". Meanwhile, bulky proteins such as this ferment or DNA moleculre and some viruses such as COVID-19 are natural nanomaterials.</p> <p>Among the manmade small things, on the micrometer scale are the MEMS devices, some of the most commonly known of which can be found in your cellphones (these are MEMS accelerometers, gyroscopes and maybe optical image stabilizers). Likewise, some of the very old integrated circuits such as the famous Intel 8080 microprocessor were characterized by the micrometer sized technology node. This means that, for example, in the Intel 8080 the minimum size and spacing for features on each layer of the chip were 6 \u03bcm. As we know, the state-of-the-art process nodes for the modern CPUs are of the order of several nm. In the world of materials science, some of the most well-known nanomaterials are carbon based: these are the buckyballs, nanotubes, graphene layers, etc. And, of course, atoms and ions are at the lowest end of the scale of things.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/#ionic-radii","title":"Ionic radii","text":"<p>Since nanomaterials are solids, and most solids are ionic, I'd like to digress a little and discuss a concept that is very useful for materials scientists, that is, the concept of ionic radii. First of all, we all know that ions are not rigid spheres and, strictly speaking, they have no radius as such. However, it helps our imagination when we think of them as of spheres. Besides, it turns out that if we ascribe some formal radii to the ions, the resulting oversimplified model may help to predict the trends in the size of the crystal lattices and even some dependent properties of materials.</p> <p> </p> An \"incorrect\", albeit very useful, rigid-sphere representation of ions (anion A and cation C) and their sizes <p>Where do we get the formal values to give to the radii? From the interatomic distances, which can be easily obtained from the structural (e.g., X-ray diffraction) data. And then we have a problem: which fraction of the interatomic distance do we give to the cation, and which - to the anion? This problem doesn't have a straightforward solution. Robert Shannon, the creator of the most widely used compilation of ionic radii,<sup>3</sup> actually defines two frames of reference: the so-called crystal and ionic radii. He says that \"crystal\" radii should be closer to the actual sizes of the ions in solids while the \"ionic\" is presented for more compatibility with the previous works. Still, surprisingly, ionic system is more widely used. While you may encounter one or the other, the important thing is not to mix them up. The systems differ by 0.14 \u00c5: the ionic radii of the anions are larger, and those of the cations - smaller than the respective crystal radii. For instance, the crystal radius of VI-coordinated \\(\\ce{O^{2-}}\\) is 1.26 \u00c5, and the ionic radius is 1.40 \u00c5.</p> <p>In the following quote of Shannon you see the factors influencing the size that we ascribe to the ions.</p> <p>Additivity of both cation and anion radii to reproduce interatomic distances is valid if one considers coordination number (CN), electronic spin, covalency, repulsive forces, and polyhedral distortion.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>There is quite a number of those factors. Some of them, such as CN and oxidation state, are taken into account in the Shannon tables. Take a look, for example, at the following two plots with the trends with which you are likely familiar from your previous general chemistry studies.</p> <p> </p> <p>Radii of some cations vs their oxidation state (left) and coordination number (right)<sup>3</sup></p> <p>There are even some works expanding the Shannon tables with the additional data that can be used within the same framework are presented.<sup>4</sup> Some of the factors, not mentioned by Shannon are, however, rather hard to estimate. For example, the temperature dependence of the ionic size. Trying to accomodate them within the model leads to creation of different radii systems, such as the one by Miller and Tidrow.<sup>5</sup> However, Shannon tables<sup>3</sup> still remain the most comprehensive and widely used data set regarding the ionic sizes.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/#classifications-of-nanomaterials","title":"Classifications of nanomaterials","text":"<p>Shape is such an important property that classification of nanomaterials can be based on their dimensionality or aspect ratio.<sup>6</sup></p> <p>We should now \"scale up\" our discussion and from the world of atoms and ions transcend to the world of nanomaterials that they make up. As the quote says, shape is very important, and among nanomaterials one can find all kinds of shapes. Below are some schematic representations of those.</p> <p> </p> <p>Dimensions of nanomaterials <sup>6</sup> <sup>7</sup> <sup>8</sup></p> <p>The real-life examples of 0-D objects are quantum dots, nanoparticles, and fullerenes. The most famous 1-D materials are the single-walled nanotubes and multi-walled carbon nanotubes. Two-dimensional materials include graphene, boron nitride (h-BN), and graphene oxide, as well as multitudinous other films and coatings. Typical 3-D nanostructured materials are nanoporous metals and ceramics, aerogels, and zeolites.</p> <p> </p> <p>Scanning electron microscopy images of 0D metal oxide nanoparticles (I),<sup>9</sup> 1D GaAs nanowires with a single nanowire in the inset (II),<sup>8</sup> and 2D and 3D silver nanocrystals (III).<sup>10</sup></p> <p>We can also categorize the nanostructured materials, or NsMs, by their dimensionality. Nanostructured materials are those with nanometer-sized microstructures. According to the shape of the crystallites, three categories of NsM may be distinguished: layer-shaped crystallites, rod-shaped crystallites (with layer thickness or rod diameters of the order of a few nanometers), and NsM composed of equiaxed nanometer-sized crystallites.</p> <p> </p> <p>Nanostructured materials<sup>11</sup></p> <p>Depending on the chemical composition of the crystallites, three categories of NsM may be grouped into four families. In the most simple case, all crystallites and interfacial regions have the same chemical composition. Examples of this family of NsM are semicrystalline polymers (consisting of stacked crystalline lamellae separated by non-crystalline regions). Quantum well (multilayer) structures are probably the most well-known examples of the second family, where the crystallites possess different chemical compositions. If the compositional variation occurs primarily between crystallites and the interfacial regions, the third family of NsM is obtained. This happens, for example, when the components of the main phase segregate preferentially at the grain boundaries. The fourth family of NsM is formed by nanometer-sized crystallites (layers, rods or equiaxed crystallites) dispersed in a matrix of different chemical composition. Precipitation-hardened alloys belong in this group of NsM. For example, nanometer-sized Ni3Al precipitates dispersed in a Ni matrix are generated by annealing a supersaturated Ni-Al solid solution are an example of such alloys. Most high-temperature materials used in jet engines of modern aircraft are based on precipitation-hardened Ni3Al/Ni alloys.</p> <p> </p> <p>Nanocomposites<sup>12</sup></p> <p>This is a different classification system that was proposed for ceramic nanocomposites. As schematically drawn in this figure, in the intra- and intergranular nanocomposites, the nanosized particles are dispersed mainly within the matrix grains or at the grain boundaries of the matrix, respectively. Such materials possess improved mechanical properties such as hardness, fracture strength and toughnessat room temperature and high temperatures. On the other hand, the nano/nano composites are made of the dispersoids and matrix grains with the nanometer-size. The primary purpose of these composites is to add new functions, such as machinability and superplasticity, to ceramics.</p>"},{"location":"introduction/#classifications-of-synthesis-methods","title":"Classifications of synthesis methods","text":"<p>Now we know what differentiates materials and nanomaterials, and we're interested (I hope) in the techniques for their preparation.

In the absence of an external stress and a chemical reaction, the energy can be lowered by decreasing the overall surface area, or reducing the surface curvature of the particles. Consider, for example, one mole of powdered substance with the molar volume \\(V_m\\), where the powder consists of monodisperse spherical particles with the radius \\(r\\).

Although the general guidelines are more or less standard,<sup>4</sup> the particular procedure depends strongly on the nature of the samples, the available tools, and the personal preferences of the operator.</p> <p>Grinding is carried out by rubbing the specimen against abrasive material. It can be done in various ways, from rubbing on a stationary sandpaper to the use of automatic devices - grinding/polishing machines. The machines contain massive metallic rotating disks (typically, 8\"/203 mm or 10\"/254 mm in diameter, 1 or 2 per machine) with controlled rotation speed and direction. On top of these disks, different thin-plate disks called \"platens\" with embedded abrasive material, sandpaper disks, or disks with polishing cloth can be fixed. This way, one machine with a set of interchangeable abrasive disks can be used to perform all required grinding and polishing steps. The grinding/polishing machines can be automatic, where the samples are pressed to the abrasive disk and rotated contrary to the disk rotation by the machine head itself, or manual, in which the sample is held by the operator, and the machine controls only the rotation of the abrasive disk.</p> <p>Grinding should start with the finest abrasive material capable of flattening the specimen and removing the artefacts from the previous operations, such as cutting.

The need for such corrections arises from the fact that, according to the Archimedes' principle, the upward buoyant force is exerted on all bodies immersed in a medium (either liquid or gas). As a result, the measured mass, \\(m_\\mathrm{meas}\\), differs from the mass of the sample in vacuum, \\(m\\), by a factor proportional to the density of the medium, \\(\\rho\\), and the volume of the sample, \\(V\\), which is the volume of the medium displaced by the sample:<sup>7</sup></p> \\[m_\\mathrm{meas} = m - \\rho V. \\label{truemass}\\] <p>During the thermogravimetric experiments, the density of gas changes, giving rise to the apparent mass gain equal to \\(V \\cdot \\Delta \\rho\\).

At the beginning of heating, warm air preferably flows along the inside of the protective tube around the sample, and thus does not reach the crucible with the sample immediately. Thus, the actual temperature of the gas is higher than the temperature sensor indicates in these conditions. This accounts for a sharp rise in the measured mass values at the beginning of the measurements. To make matters worse, the time required to achieve uniform heating of the sample chamber depends on the heating speed and the thermal conductivity of the sweep gas.</p> <p>As a consequence, it is quite hard to calculate the buoyancy corrections accurately from purely theoretical considerations. Instead, it is preferred to run the blank measurements in exactly the same conditions as in the actual measurements, including the gas compositions, flow rates and pressures, and the temperature program. Such kind of correction may even compensate for the issues not caused by buoyancy, e.g., variations in the convective gas flows exerting different pressure on the measurement crucible, the parasitic radiative heating of the balance by the oven at high temperatures, or some other less evident phenomena. In addition, to make the buoyancy similar in the blank and measurement experiments, it is customary to perform the former not with the empty crucible, but with the crucible filled with inert substance such as \\(\\ce{Al2O3}\\). This is especially important for large sample masses. The amount of the inert substance should be taken for its volume to be close to the volume of the samples in the measurement experiments.</p> <p>The corrected mass can be calculated by simply subtracting the results of the correction experiment from the results of the measurements:</p> \\[\\Delta m_\\mathrm{true} = \\Delta m_\\mathrm{meas} - \\Delta m_\\mathrm{corr}.\\]"},{"location":"labs/thermogravimetry/#calibration","title":"Calibration","text":"<p>As mass and temperature are the primary signals in TGA, both the mass scale and the temperature scale can be calibrated.

In any case, the composition of the products should be known (and, preferably, confirmed with X-ray diffraction). For our abstract oxide, the complete reduction reaction may look as</p> \\[\\ce{MO_{1 - \\delta} + (1 - \\delta)H2 -&gt;[\\mathrm{high}\\ $T$] M + (1 - \\delta)H2O}. \\label{redm}\\] <p>Using the obvious relationship,</p> \\[n_\\ce{M} = n_\\ce{MO_{1 - \\delta}},\\] <p>rewritten as</p> \\[\\frac{m_\\ce{M}}{M_\\ce{M}} = \\frac{m_\\ce{MO_{1 - \\delta}}}{M_\\ce{MO} - \\delta M_\\ce{O}},\\] <p>we obtain</p> \\[\\delta = \\frac{M_\\ce{MO}}{M_\\ce{O}} - \\frac{m_\\ce{MO_{1 - \\delta}}}{m_\\ce{M}} \\cdot \\frac{M_\\ce{M}}{M_\\ce{O}}, \\label{nonst}\\] <p>where \\(m\\) and \\(M\\) are the mass and the molar mass, \\(\\ce{MO}\\) is the stoichiometric oxide, \\(\\ce{M}\\) is the general formula of the solid reduction products, and \\(\\ce{O}\\) is the atomic oxygen. Accordingly, \\(m_\\ce{MO_{1 - \\delta}}\\) and \\(m_\\ce{M}\\) correspond to the mass of the oxide before the reduction and the mass of the solid reduction products.</p> <p>While Equations \\(\\ref{redm}\\)-\\(\\ref{nonst}\\) are written here for an imaginary binary oxide \\(\\ce{MO_{1 - \\delta}}\\), they apply equally well to any reducible complex oxide. One should only keep in mind that not every oxide can be reduced in hydrogen to the corresponding metal and understand how to write the formula for the reduction products. Consider now, for example, the following complete reduction reaction:</p> \\[\\ce{LaCoO_{3 - \\delta} + (1.5 - \\delta)H2 -&gt; 0.5La2O3 + Co + (1.5 - \\delta)H2O}. \\label{redlacoo3}\\] <p>Equation \\(\\ref{nonst}\\) can be applied to process \\(\\ref{redlacoo3}\\) by replacing the nonstoichiometric oxide, \\(\\ce{MO_{1 - \\delta}}\\), stoichiometric oxide, \\(\\ce{MO}\\), and reduced oxide, \\(\\ce{M}\\), with \\(\\ce{LaCoO_{3 - \\delta}}\\), \\(\\ce{LaCoO3}\\) and \\(\\ce{LaCoO_{1.5}}\\),<sup>13</sup> respectively.</p>"},{"location":"labs/thermogravimetry/#equipment","title":"Equipment","text":"<p>There are many scientific equipment manufacturers with thermobalances among their products, from the widely known, such as Netzsch, Setaram, Linseis, and TA Instruments to the less well-known such as CI Precision.
