# What is it?

This website provides supplementary reading materials for the "Synthesis of materials and nanomaterials" course as it is (was?) taught in the fall term of 2023 in Ural Federal University for the first and, most likely, the last time.

The main rationale behind making a website is (was?)

> I've spent a reasonable amount of time on preparing for the lectures and labs and it'd be sad for all of it to go to waste.

I hope you'll find at least any of it useful. If not, well, I'm not the most well-paid and highly qualified scientist out there, *duh*, so go and get yourself something better.

## License and Disclaimer

Due to the very nature of the course and also, in part, to the limited (*ha ha virtually nonexistent*) time that I had to prepare for it, most of the course materials were compiled from various other sources - from the textbooks, the scientific articles (both reviews and regular articles), the materials supplied by the manufacturers of scientific equipment and from the other webpages. I've made an honest attempt to acknowledge each and every source, giving all the necessary references when appropriate.

However, I must admit that I might have missed something, so if you if you've noticed that I borrowed something without mentioning the source or if you're a copyright holder and you think that I infringed upon your rights, please don't hesitate to contact me. I'm sure we could come to a peaceful arrangement, provided that all I do here is basically advertising some stuff I found on the internet :sweat_smile:.

To the things that I genuinely came up with and wrote here I give the following license:
